/*
    Heaps -> a heap is a complete binary tree that follows the heap order property

        - Complete Binary Tree (CBT) ->  all levels are completely filled except the last level, the last level is fileed from left to  right
        - Heap order property -> 1. Max heap -> Every parent node is greter than or wqual to its children
                                                the largest element is always at root
                                            
                                2. Min heap -> every parent node is smaller than or equal to its children
                                                the smallest element is always at top

        **Important -> heap is not a BST
