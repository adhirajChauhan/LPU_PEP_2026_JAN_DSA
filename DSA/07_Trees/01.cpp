/*
    Tree -> it is a non-linear, hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges
    Binary tree -> a tree is a binary tree when every node has at most two children

    Terminologies -

    1. Leaf -> a node with no children
    2. internal node -> a node which is not a leaf
    3. Siblings -> the children of same parent
    4. Length Path -> length of path is 1 less then the number of nodes on the path
    5. Ancestors and Descendents -> if there is a path from node A to Node B, then A is called an ancestor of B and B is called a descendent of A
    6 -> subtree -> any node of a tree, with all of its descendents is a subtree
    7-> Level -> the level of the node referes to its distance from the root, the root of the tree has generally level 0
    8 -> height -> the maximum level in a tree determines its height, The height of a node in a tree is the length of the longest path from that node to a leaf
    9-> Depth -> the depth of a node is the number of nodes along the path from the root to that node

    Properties of BT
        1-> if h = height of a binary tree, then
            a -> maximum number of leaves = 2^h
            b-> maximum number of nodes = 2^(h+1) - 1
        2-> if abinary tree contains m nodes at level l, it contains at mosr 2m nodes at level l + 1
        3 -> since a binary tree can contain at most 1 node at level 0(root), it can contain at most 2^l nodes at level l
        4-> the total number of eges in a full binary tree with n nodes is n - 1


        Types
        Full BT -> a tree of height h has all its leaves at level h, means all non leaf nodes of a FBT have two children, and the leaf node have no children

        Complete Binary tree -> all levels are filled except the lest level, the last level should be filled from left to right
