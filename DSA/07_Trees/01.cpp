    Tree -> it is a non-linear, hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges
    Binary tree -> a tree is a binary tree when every node has at most two children

    1. Leaf -> a node with no children
    2. internal node -> a node which is not a leaf
    3. Siblings -> the children of same parent
    4. Length Path -> length of path is 1 less then the number of nodes on the path
    5. Ancestors and Descendents -> if there is a path from node A to Node B, then A is called an ancestor of B and B is called a descendent of A
    6 -> subtree -> any node of a tree, with all of its descendents is a subtree
    7-> Level -> the level of the node referes to its distance from the root, the root of the tree has generally level 0
