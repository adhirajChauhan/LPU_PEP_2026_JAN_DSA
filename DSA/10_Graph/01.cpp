/*
    A graph G =(V, E) consist of :
    V -> Set of Vertices(nodes) -> An individual objet in Graph
    E -> Set of edges connecting pairs of vertices 

    - Directed Graph -> edges have direction
    - Undirected -> edges have no direction
    - Weighted -> edges have values (weight/ cost/distance)
    - Unweighted

    Path ->a sequence of vertices connected edges

    -Cycle -> a path that start and end at the same vertex

     Degree -> in undirected graphs -> number of edges connected to a vertex
     in directed graphs ->
        - in degree -> incoming edges
        - outdegree -> outgoing edges
