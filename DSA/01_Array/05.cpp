//Time complexity - how much time an algorthm takes as input size increses

//Big O -> represents the upper bound of running time, it gives the worst-case scanerio for an algorithm. it describes the maximum time an algoritm can take.

/*
    1. O(1) - Constant time -> the time taken doesn;t depend on the input size, the algorithm always runs in the same time.

    cout << "Hello";
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    }

    2. O(log n) -> Logarathmic time -> time grows logarithmically as the input size increses, often seen in algos that divide the input in half, like binary search

    3. O(n) -> Linear time -> the time grows directly proportional to input size
     .for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    }

    4. O(n log n) -> Linearithmic time
    a mix of linear and logarathmic, quick and merge sort

    5. O(n^2) -> Quadratic time -> time grows proportionally to the square of input size
